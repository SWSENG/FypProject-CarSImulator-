# FypProject-CarSimulator-
This Vehicle Simulator Game with using the steering wheel, pedals and shifter as an input may aim to bring the real driving experience to the public. Traditionally, people under 18 years old are not able to drive a car even though their parents are beside them until they get a P-license that passes the JPJ test. This vehicle simulator game will give the players the full experience of driving a car by using the steering wheel, pedals and shifter that really is like the player itself sitting on the car to experience the feeling of driving a car.

# High Concept
In Malaysia, there is a proposal to develop a driving simulation game aimed at helping individuals above 18 years old learn how to drive a car and obtain their P license. The game will consist of realistic controls such as a steering wheel, pedals, and a shifter, providing a more immersive experience compared to traditional mouse and keyboard inputs.

The main objective of the game is to familiarize players with driving rules and regulations before they embark on real-life driving lessons. By simulating various scenarios, players can learn how to navigate different road conditions, practice defensive driving techniques, and understand the importance of traffic laws.

One significant advantage of this game is that in the event of a virtual car accident, the damage will only be limited to the in-game vehicle. This ensures the safety of the players by eliminating the risk of harm or death. With this added security, players can freely explore and experience driving without fear or hesitation.

The driving simulation game will serve as a comprehensive preparation tool, enabling players to gain confidence and competence in driving skills. By practicing in a virtual environment, individuals can reduce the likelihood of accidents and mistakes when they eventually hit the real roads.

Overall, this game aims to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical experience by providing a safe, educational, and engaging platform for aspiring drivers in Malaysia.
